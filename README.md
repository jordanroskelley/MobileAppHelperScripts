Scripts I use when writing apps

### iconGen.sh

This script (written for Mac, as it uses sips) will generate icons for Android and iOS apps. I generally have a large source image (greater than 1000x1000), and this generates icons for all (as of this writing) targets.

For more info, try `./iconGen.sh -h`
